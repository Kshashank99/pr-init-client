## Overview

Client side app for Project Init Repo

## Running the project locally

- Clone the project locally

From the repo:

### `git clone`

- Installs dependencies required for the app to run in development mode.

On the command line or in the terminal of your preferred editor, you can run:
I usually use yarn, but for I decided to go with npm, if you want to use yarn, delete lock config for npm.
I don't think there's a way for these two configs to
be in sync.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

- Fire up the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- Fire up the tests by running:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

- Check all other available scripts in package.json
